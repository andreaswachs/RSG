Author: Andreas Wachs
Special thanks to: -

Description: This program is a tiny tool for printing out random strings. 

How to use it: Load the script into your Ruby intrepeter.

Flags and arguements.

    --a sets the program to only randomize string(s) with letters (This is the default setting)

    --n sets the program to only randomize string(s) with numbers.

    --an (a mix of both -a and -n).
    
    --min_length= set the minimum length of the generated strings (default:8).
    --max_length= set the maximum length of the generated strings (default:12).

    --count= print out how many strings the program should generate.

    --seperate_with= if --count is set, you can edit how the outputted strings will be seperated.

    --char_palette= if you instead want some other characters to be randomized, you can define your own "palette" to have the program use instead of the default ones.

    --append_palette= if you want to add extra symbols/characters to the default "palettes", you can do it by adding this.
